## Styling 
In our Laravel app, we utilized **TailwindCSS** **CSS** for styling and customizing the appearance of our website. With Tailwind, we were able to easily add pre-defined classes to our HTML elements and create a visually appealing and responsive design. We also used **JavaScript** to add interactivity to our app. By combining these two technologies, we were able to create a modern and user-friendly interface for our website, which enhanced the overall user experience.
